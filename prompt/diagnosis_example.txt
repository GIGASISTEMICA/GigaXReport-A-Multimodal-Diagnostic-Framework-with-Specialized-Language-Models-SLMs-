The panoramic radiograph shows a small radiopaque area below the mandibular angle on the right side, near the cervical vertebrae C3 and C4, consistent with soft tissue calcification. This finding is suggestive of calcified atheroma at the bifurcation of the carotid artery, indicating a possible association with systemic vascular alterations. Additionally, in this image, no changes are observed in the inferior mandibular cortex that would suggest low bone mineral density or osteoporosis. Given these findings, a specialized medical evaluation is recommended to complement the diagnosis. In cases of calcified atheromas, referral to cardiology is advised, with imaging exams such as Doppler ultrasonography or CT angiography for a detailed analysis of the carotid arteries. For bone mineral density assessment, additional tests, such as bone densitometry, may be considered depending on the clinical context.
